Hello! I'm a 15 year old cyber security, CTF and programming enthusiast who plays a lot of CTFs and do a lot bug bounty in my free time. I'm primarly active currently on hackthebox and operate under the alias 'utopi4' on there, and I'm also on Hackerone, and operate under 'sudoutopia' on there too! Most of my time is dedicated to learning, working on projects, doing a lot of CTFs and bug bounty mostly as a learning experience.
