Hello! I'm a 15 year old cyber security, CTF and programming enthusiast who plays a lot of CTFs my free time. I'm primarly active currently on hackthebox and operate under the alias 'utopi4' on there. Most of my time is dedicated to learning, working on projects, doing a lot of CTFs mostly as a learning experience and sometimes the competitive aspect of things are very fun ;) .
